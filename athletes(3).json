I have already completed my bachelors and masters degree within a 4 year span all while maintaining a 3.7 GPA. This led me to being elected to the Pac 12 All academic team from 2018-2021. I was also nominated as a William V. Campbell trophy finalist two years in a row which recognizes the college football player with the biggest impact in the classroom, on the field, and in the community. Recently, have been admitted into the UCLA School of Law where I will be pursuing my 3rd degree while I complete my last year of college eligibility. In terms of football, I come from a football legacy where my Grandpa played for the Packers under Vince Lombardi and won 2 Super Bowls. My Dad also played for the Packers. I am hoping to continue having an impact on the field, in the classroom, and in the community while pursing my NFL goals.",

As someone who has had their life shaped by track, I think it\u2019s extremely important to give back to the community and help bring up the next generation of great track athletes! I love to inspire anyone I can and help out at different events in my community ranging from coaching kids, handing out free food downtown, or just handing out water at our annual Labor Day Road Race. It brings me so much joy to see that I have accomplished one of my biggest personal goals which is to inspire those in my community and anyone I come in contact with. Theres a little pressure that comes with the territory, but it\u2019s never too much to handle and I\u2019ve begun to welcome it!

I have a strong passion to teach younger kids the importance of hard work and dedication to their craft. I also encourage them to look at the bigger picture. Although, sports, and in my case soccer, can be something that is a large identity of a person, you are going to be a person a lot longer than you are going to be a soccer player so it\u2019s important to always have fun and not put too much pressure on the sport that you love. I am from a family of six children and I have parents that are my #1 fans. I love chocolate milk and would drink it for breakfast lunch and dinner if it was available. One of my other favorite things to do is joke around-dad jokes acceptable",

I decided to transfer because I wanted to be back close to home for another year to essentially find myself as an athlete but also as a person. I have played baseball for 13+ years of my life and I have a love for the game and love to teach the youth the way to play the game. I graduated from Roxana Senior High School in 2021 where was a 3 sport varsity athlete. I will be in Roxana next summer to coach the 15u summer baseball team. Some of my main hobbies outside of my student-athlete responsibilities are that I love golfing, hanging out with friends and having a good laugh. I also like playing video games and I got a soft spot in the heart for the animals - for sure.",

With no offers I decided to walk on at Division 2 Augusta University averaged 1.4 points played 4 games I worked hard to try and earn an scholarship unfortunately my sophomore year I had a medical problem and had to sit out for 8 months. I got cleared last April in 2021. I worked harder then ever and decided to transfer to a JUCO in August of 2021 which is late to transfer and take a leap of faith. I bet on myself because I knew I had got better I had also grown from 6\u20194 to 6\u20199. I played the JUCO season averaged 13pts ,6 rbs, and 3asts and earned 2 division 1 offers. I knew I had the potential to play at a higher level of basketball so I took a risk again and played in an Unsigned JUCO showcase after this showcase I was the best player in the camp and was getting interest and offers from high and mid major schools. What I had worked for my whole life payed off! UTC MBB",

It has given me the crucial tool of leadership, time management, resilience, working well in team settings, and performing under pressure.- I am currently majoring in Business Administration with a specialization in Real Estate and a minor in Marketing at San Diego State University. During my first 3 semesters, I have managed to be honored as a Scholar Athlete through San Diego State's Athletics Department and have found my way into the Fowler College of Business Dean's List.",

I started playing football when I was 6 years old, winning multiple city championships for the CMHA Renegades. Going on to play for and graduate from the most prestigious high school in Cleveland, Benedictine. Earning multiple All State honors in my time there led me to earning 13 division 1 offers and deciding to continue my academic and athletic career at The University of Toledo. Family and loyalty are core values to me and in choosing Toledo I kept that in mind. This journey that I am on is going to be far from easy, keeping my faith in God and always remembering my \u201cwhy\u201d there is no doubt in my mind I will succeed in anything I am apart of. My why, is not just my family. It\u2019s to end generations of poverty in my bloodline. It\u2019s for all the kids in Cleveland who grew up similar to me to know there is a world outside of Cleveland, Ohio. I am the one to prove it !",

I've always wanted to be a NFL player since I was little but I actually never played football until very recent. I played soccer my whole life from the ages 3-13, and I loved the sport but I felt like I wasn't having as much fun and I really wanted to play football because my friend who was also my neighbor played on his dad's youth team. - To me that was always just so cool and looked like so much fun but I didn't end up playing until I was 21. Once the pandemic started I actually got back in touch with him and he was playing RB at ASU. I messaged him and met with him and told how I wanted to play. - He offered to train me and brought out some teammates and we all started to train during the pandemic. Afterwards I went to a Juco in Cali and did it for 1 year. Then transferred to Tiffin U now its my 2nd year ever playing football.- View more...",

      "Biography": "My story starts back in high school when my two older brothers were in a bad car accident. I spent all day at the hospital with them in which I had an important flag football game. I didn\u2019t want to play in it so I could be by my brothers side but coaches, family members, and friends convinced me to play. I walked on the field and dedicated the game to my brothers who were fighting for their lives. It ended up being the best game I have ever played. I remeber running off the field to call my mom and when she answered she told me that one of them passed away during my game. I dropped to my knees as my face filled with tears. I ended up quitting the game I love. I ended up falling into a deep depression. A few years later, I was missing him and decided to step back on the field when Coach Grayson caught a glimpse of me practicing again. She decided to give me the opportunity to play the sport I grew up around and turned me into a better person. I want to inspire others to beat the odds.",

I was a horse rider, and I enjoyed competed in dressage and barrel racing. - - I am heavily involved with FCA and have a passion for sharing the gospel to the lost sheep. I am blessed to be a part of the Tri-Abilene FCA leadership/serve team, where we plan out our gatherings, ministry, outreach, etc. - - I love playing worship on my guitar, and meeting my friends for Bible studies.

With goofiness comes responsibility, so I am constantly working whether it is volunteering or studying to keep up my grades so I can make deans list like how I did my first semester of my freshman year of college.
