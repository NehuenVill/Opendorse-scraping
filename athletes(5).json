On the field, I have been named to the MIAA All-Conference team for the last 2 years, and the All-Region team in 2019. I currently hold passing records at my school including most Career Passing Touchdowns, most single season passing touchdowns, most yards in a game, most completions in a game, and have been named MIAA Offensive Player of the week 5 times in the last two seasons.

Growing up I lived in China and studied Chinese extensively, and my eyes were also opened to global political issues. Since then I have been engaged in politics which inspired me to pursue a degree in political science. Following George Floyd\u2019s death in 2020 we had a series of team meetings with the Oregon State football team that I helped organize addressing government and how we can bring about real change in the world. After completing college I plan on attending law school and I am uncertain what field of law I am going to go into. I am unique from other college athletes because of my dedication to athletics along with my hard work off the field within the classroom. I have also volunteered helping underprivileged children in my community through serving at a daycare for low income families.",

I started my collegiate career at Division 2 West Texas A&M, with whom I shared great success: Division 2 National Title Game, 2x All-American, 2x 1st Team All-Conference. Following West Texas, I made the unlikely jump up to Division 1, and transferred to LBSU. In my first year at LBSU, I helped lead our team to its first Big West Conference Title since 2013 and earned 1st team All-Conference honors. Next season, I hope to repeat the same success while clinching a NCAA tournament birth. - - Beyond basketball, I am a civil engineering major. I have a passion for interior design and architecture, and I would like to start my own construction business when my playing career is over. In my downtime, I love to read, listen to podcasts, and trade crypto/stocks.- View more...",

However, I refused to look at my physical stature as a liability. Instead, I looked at it as an obstacle that I would face to create a story that would inspire others. - - Now, I\u2019m a starting PG for The University of Rio Grande (OH) at the NAIA level. When - arriving, due to a coaching change, I originally was going to be redshirted. This was in large part due to my physical stature. However, I didn\u2019t want to settle for that. I worked extremely hard and ended up starting in my first ever collegiate game. Through my journey, I have found a passion for marketing and inspiring others. To put the two together, I have began using my socials for a greater purpose \u2014 to encourage others that our disadvantages don\u2019t have to be liabilities. Instead, they can be the very thing that creates a story that inspires millions.",

Horses are my favorite animal. Because of that, I did vaulting (gymnastics on a moving horse) as well as riding when I was younger. I am interning at a local equestrian club helping out with taking care of the horses, going on vet calls with the veterinarian at that farm, and learning more about the riding, dressage, and show jumping industry. In my free time I love to bake as well as paint. I have a Jeep Wrangler which I take everywhere to go on joy rides in the backroads near my home. When I have time over the summer and when I'm out of college my plan is to travel the world with my best friend Nyla. When I was in high school I was a duel athlete playing volleyball and basketball making sports a year-round commitment.",

After that I spent countless hours training and practicing till the point where my parents told me to calm down and give it a rest because all I did or thought about was lacrosse. Lacrosse became part of my life and was able to do very good by my senior year having over 18 college offers. At the moment I am captain and senior of keiser University\u2019s lacrosse team as well as studying sports medicine in hopes to go to med school and do orthopedics. I am also on the Puerto Rico mens national Lacrosse team competing around the nation and in other countries.",
