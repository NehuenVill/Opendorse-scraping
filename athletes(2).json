Mental health is something that I hold near and dear to my heart, having lost a family member who was a college athlete to suicide has made me even more aware of the struggles and stress that college athletes face daily. My life long struggle with ADHD has only added to the awareness for the need to address mental health awareness among young athletes today.",

However, I knew deep down I wasn\u2019t supposed to be the one watching, but the one WINNING. I traded in my cheer bow for a mouth guard, and my life has completely changed. Rugby is more than the gnarly bruises and the padless tackling, but it is about grit, togetherness, and sacrificial love. Being a girl in this growing sport, I am so encouraged by the amazing women around me to take pride in my strength and find beauty in my muscles. Rugby is so special because no matter the body shape, speed, or ability, everyone has a purpose on the pitch. This sport has taught me so much, and I hope to spread the rugby awareness around the U.S.",

I was told I could never play football because my surgeries would interfere with the seasons. I was able to recover fast and stronger then before and made myself able to play through those hardships.

I aspired to be like him as well as a role model for the youth. I was never as athletic as he was and never achieved the accolades he did in his career. When I had lost my last high school wrestling match I was at my lowest. However, I was able to pick myself back up and lace up my shoes one more time. I decided to wrestle in college and became a starter as a true freshman at the University of Central Missouri. I'm still fairly inexperienced but I learn every day and continue to improve until no one can beat me, and I stand at the top of the national stage. I also have a growing YouTube channel that I upload on consistently. I wasn't supposed to be here right now, yet here I am, unapologetically me. - - https://kxeo.com/2021/03/15/mexico-high-school-grappler-terrell-williams-signs-national-letter-of-intent-to-wrestle-at-university-of-central-missouri/",

At Oklahoma, we strive for greatness. OU gymnasts are some of the most dedicated and hard-working people you will find in the realm of collegiate sports. We strive to be the best, which is why I am looking for brands that will help myself and my team on this journey to become national champions! Outside of gymnastics, I am passionate about filmmaking. I spend a lot of my time creating impact through my video and photo skills. I have worked with both the University of Minnesota and Oklahoma\u2019s athletic department specifically with gymnastics related content. Just recently, I helped complete a documentary about the decline of men\u2019s gymnastics. I hope that your brand will shed light on our sport!",

My brother has autism and I\u2019ve volunteered several times to work Special Olympics. I was also apart of the Key Club at my high school, which raised money for special needs students as well. Not only do I love working with special needs kids, but I love working with young athletes. Just this past week I went to Williamsburg Independent School and taught elementary girls some of the University of the Cumberlands cheers. I have now coached for two summers at Mountain Brook Gymnastics and taught younger girls the basics for gymnastics and technique. Overall, I love working with all types of athletes whether they\u2019re young or old, first year or ten year.",

When I first walked onto the team, my coach only guaranteed me one semester of playing. After a few short weeks of proving myself, I was told I would be on the team for the rest of the year. The following year I was given some scholarship and a little more the next year. I ended up 4th all time in the schools history and had the 6th best scoring average my final year at Utah Tech in the WAC. Outside of golf, I love participating and watching all sports.

It has been a challenge learning a completely new sport and I have fully embraced the difficulties that have come with it. I have fell in love with the sport of rowing and the grind of competing as a Division I athlete.- - Over the summer of 2022, after my first season rowing with UConn, I trained and competed with the USRowing U23 High Performance team. At Summer Nationals I raced in both the pair which advanced to the semi finals, and the coxed four which placed 2nd in the finals. - - I am in the nursing program at UConn and I am very passionate about my future in that field. I hope to one day go back to school and work towards obtaining my doctorate in nursing practice.- View more...",

Last year at San Jacinto we made it to the Junior College World Series, and playing in front of that crowd and seeing the impact we had on all the fans truly reinforced my motivation to play in the MLB. While at San Jacinto we held multiple Special Needs days in which children from all over the city came to play baseball and have fun. This was a huge eye opener to me about the importance of sports and the impact I can have on children's lives. Seeing their faces light up and their problems seemingly vanish for a couple of hours engraved a lasting memory in my heart that I will never forget.",

With a year left of eligibility, I wanted to pursue something that would push me to my limits. Texas Tech reached out and I couldn\u2019t be more excited to represent the Red Raider baseball team and help this team get back to Omaha. Now as a graduate student pursuing a sports management degree, I will spend more time contributing to this community and teaching the youth about the game of baseball. As an athlete, it is my responsibility to show young players how great this game is, and to always dream big.",
