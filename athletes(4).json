I was raised on a beef cattle ranch, which instilled many life lessons and made me who I am today. I appreciate the friends and family who have helped me evolve and gain perspective over the years. As I have grown older, I have learned to hone in on my creative skills by creating clothing designs for our family ranch. - I started playing basketball when I was in second grade, and it never stopped since. My family and I would travel every summer to tournaments all over the country, which prepared me for collegiate level play. I\u2019ve always enjoyed a fast paced game, probably because I\u2019m usually one of the smallest on the court. The time, traveling, and sacrifices that my family made for me will never be forgotten. Looking back, some of my worst days playing ball were some of my best seasons of growth, and I\u2019m so grateful for this sport that has helped me lean on the people that I love. - - https://opndr.se/sadie-chisum- View more...",

      "Biography": "I am a Sports Management major and senior defensive player at Central Methodist University. I attended West Jefferson High School in New Orleans, La, where I posted the most sacks in a single game. I am a proud part of the CMU 2021 football team who won the NANA District Championship for the first time since 1975. I aspire to play professional sports and open an educational and sports facility for student athletes to gain strategic testing skills and grow their brand. Currently, I have a national Logistics Certification and a local real estate license. I look forward to being a positive, contributing factor to my community, as my parents have been for the past 30 years. As well, I released my first musical album within the past two years and garnered over 100,000 streams with limited to no promotion. All said, I am blessed, and am excited about the future for all!",

I enjoy art, fashion, and traveling; but, I also greatly enjoy learning about science and new technology being developed throughout the world.- - I am undecided in my major, however I hope to help others one day through advocacy for social and political change. In my senior year of high school I was a part of a student led group that protested the dress code of my school which we felt was discriminatory towards women and gender queer students. My group was successful and the dress code was changed to be fair for all students. - - One focus of mine is advocacy for the acceptance of LGBT youth and uplifting voices of those who have historically been discriminated against. I also make efforts to advocate for political change to fight climate change.

Each time I come back and feel great, one small move has ripped me from the thing that makes me the happiest, 4 times. As a 19 year old, recovering from my 4th ACL tear, realizing this is my last chance to play my sport, it has given me a chance to truly appreciate the sport. Each tear has given me a new perspective and I\u2019ve learned something from each injury, but the most important part is to remember to fight. Fight for what you love to do, it is all a mental game. It is all possible and I would love to share my story with athletes who have trouble getting through their injuries and the mental battle and grit it takes to come back. I\u2019m here to tell them, it gets better, but it\u2019s up to them and how they push themselves to be the best version.",

I am a huge people person that enjoys talking with others, sharing similar experiences/ideas, and collaborating on a common objective. I regard myself as a leader and a \"go getter,\" and I always intend to complete any assignment efficiently and effectively. I'm excited about the prospect of becoming a brand ambassador for a product that will benefit me on the court, as volleyball puts a lot of strain on the body. I'm all in to help show off any product that deals with recuperation, electrolytes, or protein, whether it's for other athletes at St. Thomas University or followers on my social media platforms. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and for considering my request. I hope to hear from you.",

Additionally, I love to cook, focusing primarily on making holistic and hormonally-balanced recipes. Here at GCU I am a History Major and intend on one day becoming either a high school history teacher or a historian. However, with that being said, I have a huge heart for others and would jump at any chance to do humanitarian or service work as well.

When I workout everything else going on in my life pauses, it is like a form of mediation. I love working out with others and pushing others to reach their full potential as well. There is no better feeling than laying in bed at night knowing I gave the day, workout, soccer practice, and people around me every ounce of passion I have!",

My name is Sabrina, and I\u2019m a 26 year old college student who is planning to attend Siena Heights University in the fall to earn my bachelors in Graphic Design and bowl for the women\u2019s team. I have two associates degrees already, in graphic design and general studies, so I\u2019m excited to continue my education and earn my bachelors degree. Getting to this point has been difficult for me, as I\u2019ve encountered various medical conditions over the years that forced me to slow down my education and focus on my health. The current concern I am dealing with is being diagnosed with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome back in March, and getting used to what that diagnosis means. My other health issue I\u2019m dealing with is that I fell down the stairs back in May and caused a complete foot dislocation and a maissonueve fracture, which had to be surgically repaired with plates and screws. I\u2019m not allowing these concerns to rule my life, and look forward to attending Siena in the fall!",

I\u2019m also a biology major with a concentration in ecology, evolution, and organismal biology. I\u2019m a massive animal lover and my goal is to work with animals in the future. I love being in nature, and any opportunity to see animals I will jump on immediately! In my free time I love to be with my friends and family (including pets), preferably at the beach!",

In my senior year of Lacrosse I was named the South region player of the year along with an All-American accolade. Along with lacrosse I spend most of my time coaching kids through lacrosse, either practices for teams or private sessions. I\u2019m very passionate about this because I want to grow the lacrosse community, especially coming from Texas where lacrosse is not as big. I want to give back to the community that brought me up.

I am studying to become a speech and hearing specialist and hope to make a life of serving people with disabilities. I know what it's like to need help. I have dyslexia and received help at a very young age which empowered me to reach my full potential. - - When I'm not studying or working on improving my swimming I love spending time in the mountains. I grew up in Indiana, but having spent a lot of time in Colorado, skiing is my second favorite sport. One of the reasons I love living in the friendly town of Laramie is because it's so close to the beautiful Snowy Mountain Range. - - I am forever grateful to be a University of Wyoming Cowgirl!- View more...",

My area of study is communications with a concentration of journalism and media studies. - - Growing up in Canada meant I had over half the year with no golf season. It was within this gap where I also played competitive hockey until the age of 20. I gave up golf at the age of 16 after a very successful junior career. Some still ask why this happened and what drove me to leave the game for three years, but it was over the course of those few years that growth and change in my life happened for the better. Along came Reedley College where I was given the opportunity to re-invent my game and was given a shot at redemption. I have many people to be thankful for along the way but ending up at Monterey Bay as my transfer program has given me a brand new appreciation for the game of golf competitively and a outlook on life that is invaluable.",
