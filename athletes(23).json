I attended St. Sabina grammar school where Father Pfleger was a intricate part, in our schools success! Once I graduated, I attended St. Rita of cascia which is an catholic/private school for all boys. Being outnumbered by other races at the school, helped me find my true passion and love within myself and basketball. I earned a spot on the JV team as a freshman, and also the starting point guard spot. Going into my Sophomore year i made the Varsity team, with playing a long side of a lot of high recruits. We all managed to go to Division 1 schools. I earned a basketball scholarship to go to Tennessee State University. I walked in liberal arts, business, and sociology.",

I preferred snowboarding at a young age, my mom would work in the clinic and I would snowboard the bunny hill at Snowbird until she got off. I joined the Snowbird Ski Team at 6 years old and couldn\u2019t get enough of it, I loved the big family skiing provided. When I was 10 I went and watched some races at the Olympics and saw Bode win Silver. I was inspired and knew I could maybe get there some day. Fast forward, I made the US Ski Team at 19. Three weeks before Sochi games, I threw some great runs together and made the Olympic Team at 22. Throughout the last 10 years I\u2019ve taken College Classes every summer and I\u2019m about halfway done. This summer I took an Entrepreneur class and loved it. I love to give back to my local ski team and recently I did an hour long Q and A with the teenage kids.",

I eventually turned that walk on opportunity to a full scholarship, team captain for three years, and helped our team to historic rankings and records for the university. Individually at the university I was able to win two individual collegiate events (2019 Wisconsin, 2021 Stanford), as well as selected twice to All Mountain West Team.I have also qualified for the US Amateur twice, first in 2019 and the following year in 2020, advancing to the Round of 32. I received conditional status on the Canadian Tour in 2021, unfortunately no golf due to the pandemic, and advanced to the second stage of Korn Ferry Tour Q School. I am an extremely hard work and don\u2019t take anything for granted. I would love to help showcase your brand on my journey to the PGA Tour. Thank you.",

In Tokyo 2020 he competed individually, placing seventh in the 200m butterfly.- - Otherwise, Gunnar really enjoys cooking and has mastered the art of grilling a medium-rare steak. The impetus of this love of cooking came from the need to intake between 6,000-8,000 calories a day while he was training. He figures that when you're eating that much, you'd better be able to cook.",

I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve eaten burritos bigger than that. Additionally, I have competed in 3 World Championships (2013, 2015, & 2019). I have a Bachelors in Science in Psychology from The College at Brockport, and am currently working on my Masters in School Counseling. An area I feel strongly about is encouraging blind and visually impaired children to get involved in sports. I have volunteered at Camp Abilities (Brockport chapter) for 4 years as a motivational speaker and swim instructor. This is close to my heart due to the Camp\u2019s impact on introducing me to the Paralympic movement as a camper myself in 2007.",

My kids, 2nd and 4th grade at the time, learned an even bigger lesson watching that finish than I am sure they would have seeing me get bronze. - Rough 2020: my dad who I was very close with passed away, I worked as the primary PT in a skilled nursing facility through the thick of COVID, I helped as my kids transitioned in/out of in-person learning, and then my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was too much, and I ended up telling my doctor in January that I felt no motivation and little joy. Thankfully, I knew to ask and she knew to help. This said, I am just excited to be going to Tokyo 2020 in good spirits and with my kids (now 7th&9th grade) cheering me on from home.",

I\u2019m currently holding a fundraiser to run in the New York marathon and all the money goes to Run For the Kids, an organization that provides materials and resources for children in New York to get involved in running and physical activity. Currently, I have a few marathons planned for the end of the year and am training to maybe get into longer distances next year. I would love to get to the next level whether that be semi professional or professional. Outside of running I work as a physical therapy aide and am applying June 2022 to medical school. I have a variety of interests including chronic pain, palliative care, global health, preventative health, sports medicine, global music, and philanthropy work in impoverished nations.",

I started lacrosse later than most so I went 110% into it which resulted in a lot of self-pressure. In college, my mental health declined and it was a battle to show up every day. I realized that although I smiled and continued to perform, no one was talking about internal challenges or mental health. I reached out to resources, and helped pioneer Hope Happens Here on my campus, which provided therapy specific to athletes in hopes to break the stigma around mental health. Without the resources in college I wouldn't be here today. - - I continue to use the lessons that sports have taught me to continue to better myself. I am on the first US Women's Box Lacrosse team and on the Board of Directors for the Women's Box Lacrosse Association. - - My purpose is to continue sharing my story in hopes to continue the conversation around mental health.- View more...",

It killed both of them instantly but I was found 40 feet from the explosion hanging onto life. My legs were severely injured and I became a survivor and a double below-knee amputee. - I was adopted at 20 months old by my family in Missouri and became the youngest of 7 siblings. - - I have always embraced being different and I want to help empower young girls to accept their differences and overcome their circumstances. - - I have built my Instagram promoting a positive message with humor and fun. - - I came from a family of athletes and was introduced to the Challenged Athletes Foundation when I was 8. This foundation introduced Me to all the options of sports in the para community. - I qualified for the USA emerging swim team at the age of 12 and after a year delay for Covid I was named to the Paralympic team at the age of 18.- View more...",
