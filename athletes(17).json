I'm from a small town outside Boston, and now live and train in Utah. In addition to skating, I'm a student at the University of Utah. I hope to pursue a degree in global health with the goal of leveling the playing field when it comes to the opportunity for a healthy life across the world. I hope to minor in Mandarin. My favorite things are laughing and getting outdoors (esp w/ my dog)!- My athletic journey has been all about working hard and striving for improvement every day, big or small. I didn\u2019t start as the most naturally talented skater, so know anything can be done with the right work ethic and attitude. I highly value a team atmosphere in sport and finding a way to contribute a fun and positive mindset to whatever I'm doing. I love volunteering my time to help communities that need it as I couldn't have gotten this far without support from my own communities.",

Instead, it is the spirit of living life to the fullest regardless of circumstances. - - Since his surgery, Tokyo 2020 bronze medalist, Jarryd Wallace, has competed in three Paralympic Games, set four World Records and became a three-time World Championship Gold Medalist. In addition to his athletic career, he is focused on developing affordable running blades to help increase opportunities for other amputees to be active.- View more...",
