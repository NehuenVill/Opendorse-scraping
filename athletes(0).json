Football is my passion and truly has taught me so many lessons and has developed me into the man I am today. I am an FAA certified private pilot, and love to enjoy flying in my free time. Another passion of mine is helping kids who can\u2019t gain weight, because I was the kid high school who struggled putting on mass. I was only 175 pounds with no real shot of playing at the collegiate level, until I started working out and eating right to get all the way up to 240 pounds. I developed my own fitness app and website called Flight Gym. I combined my love for fitness and flying in order to make a difference in kids lives.

I'm from Othello, Washington, and majoring in American Ethnic Studies, English and minoring in Spanish. I love to lift weights, listen to music, go on hikes, hang out with friends, and play video games, especially Warzone. I also love to coach and have had a few experiences with that, thanks to UW Men's Soccer camps. I've played multiple sports before I decided to dedicate my life to soccer. I've played Baseball, Football, Wrestling, and Volleyball. I've also traveled quite a few times because of soccer and family. I've been to Guadalajara, Mexico to visit family, while also being able to travel to California, New York, Colorado, Arizona, and soon Scotland this summer too. I've had the greatest experience heading down to the NCAA final and hope to have that experience once again. I am definitely grateful for all the experiences that I have had throughout my life. I love to give back to community too.",

This helped propel me to being a All-State athlete in Texas for division 5A. In college, I finished third in the Big East conference in the 100 yard butterfly. This was a new school record.

Determined to continue playing, I moved to west Des Moines iowa where a full senior season could be played. Over three states, 6 years, and countless ups and downs I was blessed with the opportunity to play at Kansas.

Over the years, I\u2019ve been exposed to countless hours of teaching and training about how to maintain peak fitness. This insight sparked my passion to aid others in achieving their athletic dreams and recovering from the inevitable injuries which present us with the opportunity to come back even stronger. I for one have had my fair share of gruesome and unfortunate injuries which have set me back considerably at times. However, I never cease to let a dull and dark time hold me back from achieving the ambitions I hold.",

While I am an athlete, I do not find my identity in my athletic ability. I am an active member of my church from my hometown. Annually, my church and I attend a mission trip in Fairmont, WV, to help those in desperate need of basic living necessities. I aspire to become an engineer to gain experience in problem-solving. I genuinely feel that I have a purpose\u2013to serve. I am not waiting until graduation to \u201cstart my life/career.\u201d I have already started. I hope to encourage and uplift the people around me. I want to better the people around me on a day-to-day basis. I am so fortunate to have this opportunity as a student-athlete to be able to do so with my friends in the classroom and practice/competition. - - TikTok @lydvrob",

I\u2019m a huge mental health advocate, I realized taking care of self is most important.

Fighting injury caused by football in high school I did not get the exposure I had hoped and landed with nearly no offers out of high school. In the summer of 2021 I qualified and competed in the US Junior Amateur at Country Club of North Carolina where injury came back around worse than ever. Since then I have continued to fight and work to be the best golfer I can be and currently hold a +2.2 handicap as I fight for a National Championship under legendary NCAA Champion coach Kim Haddow.

I graduated from Palisades Charter High School before I came enrolled here @UNM. I've spent a little more than a year in Albuquerque a part of the football team, practicing and getting familiar with the life of a D1 Football Player. I normally spend my free time watching sports, playing board games, or working out. I want to be the best football player UNM has ever had and Brian Urlacher is steep competition. I look forward to starting a great 2nd year of college. Thank you!",

I have a 124k followers on TikTok and 10k on Instagram. My whole goal is to inspire kids to chase their dreams and to never give up . My mom is a single school teacher and has always taught me how to work for a better life. What sets me apart from other kids is that I don\u2019t have much and I\u2019m okay with that . I think that\u2019s what makes me a true underdog because while most athletes get to just go to school and play football, I have to have a job on top of all that so I can pay the game I love . So instead of getting to go out at nights I\u2019m either in the gym or driving for Uber so I can pay my bills. I do all this because of the people that said I could never make it and for the kids that look up to me. Me giving them kids HOPE that are not highly recruited is what keeps me going . If you guys consider me for a NIL deal I will be forever grateful !",

I am also a huge advocate for resources for injured athletes, as I have been through 2 total ACL reconstructions. I did my senior year undergrad research project on the impacts that stress and mental health have on athletes and making them more susceptible to injuries.

Although I would like to go as far as I can with track, with one or both of these majors I hope to eventually establish a program that focuses on mental health for athletes as well as children. As I am a huge mental health advocate, part of this program would help build mental strength, confidence, focus on self love/worth, and a maintaining a positive mindset. The other part of this program would focus on helping children who have endured traumatic situations find healthy coping methods so it does not affect them as heavily later on in life.",
